# Oasis_IMB

 
Description
-----------

Oasis_IMB is an Open Source Immersed Boundary Navier-Stokes solver written in Python. The solver is based on the Oasis CFD solver originally developed by Mikael Mortensen, Kristian Valen-Sendstad and Joakim Bo (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2014.10.026) and on the boundary condition enforced Immersed Boundary method proposed by Ren et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2011.12.006). We utilize Python Numpy and Python Scipy to modify the NSfracStep solvers. The Coupled solvers and LES module are in development. This is a naive implementation only for demonstration purposes.
